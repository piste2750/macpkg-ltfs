For information about connectivity and configurations for the IBM Spectrum Archive Single Drive Edition on IBM branded tape drives,
refer to the online IBM Spectrum Archive Single Drive Edition documentation that is available on IBM Knowledge Center:

  http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/STQNYL

For information about latest versions of drive firmware,
and hardware interoperability known issues and limitations, refer to the IBM System Storage Interoperation Center (SSIC).

The IBM SSIC can be found at the following website:
  http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/storage/config/ssic

For OEM branded tape drives, ask your supplier about the interoperability.

Usage example:
==============

1. Add /usr/local/bin to the command search path.

  The LTFS package is installed under /usr/local.
  Add /usr/local/bin to your command search path by issuing the following command:

  $ export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

2. Format the tape cartridge in the LTFS format by issuing the following command for your platform:

   Linux
      $ mkltfs -d /dev/IBMtape0

   Mac OS X
      The device name can be confirmed by the system profiler
      $ mkltfs -d 0

3. Mount the formatted tape cartridge by issuing the following commands for your platform:

   Linux
     $ mkdir /mnt/ltfs
     $ ltfs /mnt/ltfs -o devname=/dev/IBMtape0

   Mac OS X
     $ mkdir /mnt
     $ mkdir /mnt/ltfs
     $ ltfs /mnt/ltfs -o devname=0

4. Unmount the tape cartridge by issuing the following command.
   (This command flushes the data buffer of the file system to the tape cartridge and prepares to eject the cartridge.)

  $ umount /mnt/ltfs
    OR
  $ fusermount -u /mnt/ltfs

Note to users:
==============

  General Notice
  --------------
  - Refer to the documents distributed with the tape drive and the IBM Spectrum Archive.
  - The IBM LTO and enterprise tape drives provide the hardware for data compression. The amount of
    written data on a tape can vary from the original data size.


Known Issues:
==============

  1. (Mac OS X)  IBM Spectrum Archive does not support moving a folder within LTFS formatted cartridge.
     Any attempt to move a folder in such a manner will result in an "operation not permitted" error,
     and the operation will be ignored.  The user can still move a file within LTFS formatted cartridge,
     and the user can also move a folder from LTFS formatted cartridge to a non-LTFS file system or vice versa.
  2. (Mac OS X)  Mac OS X's Spotlight will not display the files on LTFS formatted cartridge as a result of a search.
